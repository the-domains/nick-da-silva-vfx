description: "My name is Nick (as you can tell from the title of my website). I'm a VFX artist living in LA. I love everything FX related. Procedural animation, fluid simulations, destruction, particles, scripting, you name it. Every new shot offers new challenges and always new opportunities to learn. I enjoy learning and I'm always looking to improve my skills as a technical artist."

My name is Nick (as you can tell from the title of my website). I'm a VFX artist living in LA. I love everything FX related.

Outside of my work, I love my family and cherish every moment I get to spend with them. My wife is my best friend and definitely brings out the best in me. We have two beautiful little children. My family is the joy of my life.
